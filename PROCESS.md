 Analysis of Skipped Rows

  16,568 rows were skipped from SDWA_VIOLATIONS_ENFORCEMENT.csv (11% of 151,085 total rows).

  Characteristics of Skipped Rows:

  1. Missing VIOLATION_ID: All skipped rows have an empty VIOLATION_ID field (primary key)
  2. They are enforcement actions without violations:
    - These appear to be standalone enforcement actions from the 1980s
    - Most common types:
        - SIA: State Violation/Reminder Notice
      - SIE: State Public Notification requested
  3. Time period: Primarily historical data from 1981-1989
    - 1984: 1,395 records
    - 1985: 2,268 records
    - 1986: 1,934 records
    - 1987: 2,171 records
    - 1988: 1,810 records
    - 1989: 3,048 records
    - Few scattered records from 1997-1999
  4. Data structure: These rows have:
    - PWSID (water system ID)
    - ENFORCEMENT_ID
    - ENFORCEMENT_DATE
    - ENFORCEMENT_ACTION_TYPE_CODE
    - But NO violation details

  Why They Were Skipped:

  These represent enforcement actions that aren't linked to specific violations in the database. They appear to be legacy enforcement records from the 1980s when the tracking system may have been
  different. Since VIOLATION_ID is part of the primary key, these records couldn't be imported without violating database constraints.

  Impact:

  - Successfully imported 134,516 violation/enforcement records
  - The 16,568 skipped records are mostly 35-40 year old enforcement notices
  - No recent or critical compliance data was lost
  - Core violation tracking data remains intact


  used mindpilot early on


tried a multi agent system but it dint work

context7

  claude --continue --dangerously-skip-permissions

  3 terminals

  only handwritten code was anthropic key and changing a model id

  got hunup on copilot kit not haveing an ANthorpic adapter. lame
